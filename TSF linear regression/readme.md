Problem Statement: Predict the percentage of student based on number of study hours.

SOLUTION: Linear Regression - It models target prediction value based on independent variables.

Hypothesis Function for simple linear regression: y = A + B.x, where y is the label of the data, x are input variables, A is intercept, B is slope.
